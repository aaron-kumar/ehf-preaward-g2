//Skriv kort om DPS- prosessen for brukerne.

The Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) is a procurement procedure for procurement of goods and services, and will run as an electronic process.

Contracting authorities can for example establish a DPS. This process should be established to identify different
types of requirement, which can be divided into categories as products or services.

In general, DPS is a two stage process:

* Step 1: Initial setup- all suppliers who meet the selection criteria will be admitted to the DPS, and

* Step 2: Individual contracts are awarded.

//In addition, DPS can streamline procurement for both suppliers and contracting authorities. The DPS is more flexible
//In this specification, we consider about one process, called qualification, in the DPS process.
