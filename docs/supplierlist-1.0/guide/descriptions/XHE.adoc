Central purchasing body can send non-standardized tender documents, e.g. catalogue template, together with
EHF Supplier list by using Exchange Header Envelope.

=== Header Envelope Information

The metadata information about the Exchange Header Envelope need to be provided, i.e XHE version identifier,
Specification identifier, Business process type identifier, Header information and Payload information.
Note that all namespaces need to be provided before the header envelope information.

----
<1> XHE version number
<2> XHE specification identifier (`CustomizationID`)
<3> XHE business process type identifier (`ProfileID`)
<4> Header information
<5> Payloads - information about each relevant payload


=== Header Information

Information relevant to the header envelope need to be provided in element `xha:Header`, and will be used
to handle the envelope. The header envelope contains information about the business scope, where contracting
authority can specify the criterion of the scope of business.

<1> Identifier
<2> Unique universal identifier (UUID), recommend version 4.
<3> Date and time for when this header envelope was created.
<4> Business scope
<5> The property of the business scope
<6> The value of the property


=== Payload Information

information about the specific payload need to be provided in element `xha:Payload`.
For example, the payload instance can be catalogue template, or other tender documents.
