= Sending Tendering Documents

Central purchasing body can send non-standardized tender documents, e.g. catalogue template, by using EHF
Document Folder which is based on Exchange Header Envelope.

== Exchange Header Envelope (XHE)

The Exchange header envelope (XHE) describes either a header to or an envelope of a set of payloads
that contains information about the content. Read more about Exchange Header Envelope
link:https://docs.oasis-open.org/bdxr/xhe/v1.0/cs02/xhe-v1.0-cs02-oasis.html#S-HEADER-AND-ENVELOPE-INFORMATION[here].

//The metadata information about the Exchange Header Envelope (`XHE`) need to be provided. The metadata is  XHE version
//identifier, Specification identifier, Business process type identifier, Header information and Payload information.

Following metadata information about the Exchange Header Envelope (`XHE`) need to be provided (see Figure (3)):

. XHE version identifier,
. Specification identifier (`CustomizationID`),
. Business process type identifier (`ProfileID`),
. General header information, and
. Payload information.

//The following figure illustrates the main idea with XHE:
//is developed to be either a header as an integral part of a business document, or an envelope as a wrapper that contains the business documents. Specifically,

//Benefit of using XHE:

//. routing of business documents,
//. simplifying the bundling of several business documents and support document into one package,
//. simplifies the processing of business documents.

<1> XHE version number
<2> XHE specification identifier (`CustomizationID`)
<3> XHE business process type identifier (`ProfileID`)
<4> Header information
<5> Payloads - information about each relevant payload


=== Header Information

Information relevant to the header envelope need to be provided in element `xha:Header`, and will be used
to handle the envelope. The header envelope contains information about the business scope, where contracting
authority can specify the criterion of the scope of business.

<3> Date and time for when this header envelope was created.
<4> Business scope
<5> The property of the business scope
<6> The value of the property


=== Payload Information

Information about the set of payloads within the envelope need to be provided in element `xha:Payloads`, and
information about the specific payload need to be provided in element `xha:Payload`.
For example, the payload instance can be catalogue template, or other tender documents.
