= Sending Tendering Documents

Central purchasing body can send structured or non-structured tender documents by using EHF Document
Folder which is based on OASIS Exchange Header Envelope 1.0 CS02.

== Exchange Header Envelope (XHE)

The Exchange header envelope (XHE) describes either a header to or an envelope of a set of payloads
that contains information about the content. In EHF Document Folder, the main idea with using XHE is to
pack all structured and non-structured tender documents in payloads. For example, the central purchasing
body can send catalogue templates (a pdf file) to the contracting authorities in a DPS.

//The metadata information about the Exchange Header Envelope (`XHE`) need to be provided. The metadata is  XHE version
//identifier, Specification identifier, Business process type identifier, Header information and Payload information.

To send a EHF Document Folder following metadata information about the Exchange Header Envelope (`XHE`)
need to be provided (see Figure (3)):

. XHE version identifier,
. Specification identifier (`CustomizationID`),
. Business process type identifier (`ProfileID`),
. General header information, and
. Payload information.

//The following figure illustrates the main idea with XHE:
//is developed to be either a header as an integral part of a business document, or an envelope as a wrapper that contains the business documents. Specifically,

//Benefit of using XHE:

//. routing of business documents,
//. simplifying the bundling of several business documents and support document into one package,
//. simplifies the processing of business documents.

<5> Payloads - information about each relevant payload


=== Header Information

Information relevant to the header envelope need to be provided in element `xha:Header`, and will be used
to handle the envelope. The header envelope contains information about the business scope, where contracting
authority can specify the criterion of the scope of business. There is also important to state the senders and
receivers organi

=== Payload Information

Information about the set of payloads within the envelope need to be provided in element `xha:Payloads`, and
information about the specific payload need to be provided in element `xha:Payload`.
For example, the payload instance can be catalogue template, or other tender documents.
