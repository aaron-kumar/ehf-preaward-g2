= Introduction

The Dynamic purchasing system (DPS) is an electronic procurement procedure (system) that can be established by, for example,
a Central Purchasing body to purchase works, goods and services from Contracting Authorities. DPS is full electronic process, and
compared to other framework agreements in DPS new suppliers can join at any time.

A sub-process of the whole DPS-process is called EHF Document folder, where the main idea is that Central Purchasing
body can send a document folder with several tender documents to the Contracting Authorities connected to Central
Purchasing body. The purpose of this document is to describe EHF Document Folder process with a process diagram
and use cases, then describe roles and parties together with role diagram, and finally give detailed description
of important parts of EHF Supplier list. Appendices with supporting information is provided at the end of the
document.
