The Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) is a full electronic procurement procedure for procurement of goods, works and services, where
a new supplier can join at any time.

DPS is a two stage process:

* Step 1: Initial setup- all suppliers who meet the selection criteria will be admitted to the DPS, and

* Step 2: Individual contracts are awarded.
